# Docker and React project with Continuous Integration (via GitHub Actions)

This project was completed as an experiment while I am learning Docker. It has a basic React frontend and Docker is used to handle dependencies, and running, testing and building the project. Travis CI was originally going to handle CI but I instead decided to go with GitHub Actions.
